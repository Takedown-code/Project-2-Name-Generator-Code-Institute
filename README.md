# AI-Powered Name Generator

## Project Overview
The **AI-Powered Name Generator** is a dynamic front-end web application that generates unique names based on different categories such as **Fantasy, Baby, Sci-Fi, and Mystical**. Users can generate a name, save their favorites, and view trending names through a **real-time popularity chart**.

This project demonstrates **interactive functionality** using **JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**, with external support from **Chart.js** for data visualization.

## Features
- **Generate Unique Names:** Users can select a name type and generate a random name.
- **Save Favorite Names:** Users can save names to a list for later reference.
- **Trending Names Chart:** A real-time chart displays the most popular generated names.
- **Interactive UI:** The application has a clean, user-friendly interface with responsive design.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** – Structuring the web page
- **CSS3** – Styling and layout design
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Handling interactions and data logic
- **Chart.js** – External library for rendering the popularity chart
